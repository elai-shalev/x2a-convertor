Analyze this directory for migration to Ansible. 

User requirements: {user_requirements}

Start by exploring the directory structure to understand what technology stack is currently being used, then create a comprehensive `{migration_plan_file}` file that follows the template structure.

Focus on:
1. Identifying the current technology (Chef, Puppet, Salt, etc.)
2. Cataloging all modules/cookbooks/manifests
3. Mapping dependencies and external requirements
4. Identifying security configurations
5. Estimating migration complexity and timeline
6. Providing coordination guidance for teams

Write the complete migration plan to a file called `{migration_plan_file}` in the root directory.
