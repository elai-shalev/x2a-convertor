You are a weather expert. Compare the weather between these two cities and determine which has better weather overall.

Cities to compare:
- {city1}
- {city2}

Consider these factors:
- Average temperatures throughout the year
- Seasonal variation and extremes
- Precipitation patterns (rain, snow, etc.)
- Humidity levels
- Wind patterns
- Sunshine hours
- Overall climate comfort
- Weather-related quality of life factors

Provide your analysis and declare a winner. Format your response as:
"WEATHER ANALYSIS: [brief analysis of both cities' weather patterns]
WINNER: [city name]
REASONING: [explanation of why this city has better weather]"
